This repository contains SUAVE (Self-adaptive Underwater Autonomous Vehicle Exemplar). SUAVE focuses on the scenario of pipeline inspection
for a single autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The AUVâ€™s mission is to first search for a pipeline on the seabed, then follow and inspect the pipeline.

It clearly separates the system into two subsystems: the managed subsystem and the managing subsystem. The managed subsystem implements the functionalities required by the AUV to perform the pipeline inspection mission, and the managing subsystem implements the adaptation logic.  This ensures that this exemplar can be reused with several different managing subsystems, providing that they satisfy the necessary [requirements](#requirements-for-a-managing-subsystem). The usability of the exemplar is showcased with [MROS2](https://github.com/meta-control/mc_mros_reasoner), the implementation of the self-adaptation framework [Metacontrol](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/model-based-self-awareness-patterns-for-autonomy).

This repository is organized as following:
- The package [suave](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave) contains the managed subsystem functionalities
- The package [suave_monitor](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_monitor) contains the monitor nodes
- The package [suave_missions](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_missions) contains the AUV's missions
- The package [suave_metrics](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_metrics) contains the a node used for collecting mission metrics
- The package [suave_metacontrol](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_managing/suave_metacontrol) contains the metacontrol implementation of the managing subsystem
- The package [suave_random](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_managing/suave_random) contains the implementation of a random managing subsystems
- The package [suave_bt](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_managing/suave_bt) contains the behavior tree implementation of the managing subsystem
- The package [suave_msgs](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/suave_msgs) contains suave's specific ros msgs
- The folder [docker](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/tree/main/docker) contains the dockerfiles and scripts used to package this repository

## Use SUAVE with Docker

You can pull and run the exemplar as a Docker container using the following command. Keep in mind you need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your computer and running.

In a terminal on your computer run:
```Bash
docker run -it --shm-size=512m -p 6901:6901 -e VNC_PW=password --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ghcr.io/kas-lab/suave:main
```

Optionally you can add the parameter `-v <absolute_path_host_compute>:/home/kasm-user/suave/results` to save the results into your computer, replace `<absolute_path_host_compute>` with the absolute path of where you want the data to be saved in your computer, e.g:

```Bash
docker run -it --shm-size=512m -v $HOME/suave_results:/home/kasm-user/suave/results -p 6901:6901 -e VNC_PW=password --security-opt seccomp=unconfined ghcr.io/kas-lab/suave:main
```

**SEAMS2023:** To use the docker image used in the SEAMS2023 paper, replace `ghcr.io/kas-lab/suave:main` with `ghcr.io/kas-lab/suave:seams2023`.

Once the container is up and running, you can interface with it through your web browser. The container will be hosted locally at the port specified, in this case 6901. So in your browser, go to
`http://localhost:6901`.

A dialog will request a username and password, these are shown below, with the password being specifiable in the run command.

 - **User** : `kasm_user`
 - **Password**: `password`

Now you can proceed to [run the exemplar](#run-suave).

### Build Docker images locally
To build the docker images locally, run:

```Bash
./build_docker_images.sh
```

## Install SUAVE locally
To install the exemplar locally, you have to [install Gazebo Garden](#install-gazebo-garden), [install ROS2 Humble](#install-ros2-humble), [install ArduSub](#install-ardusub), [install the ArduSub plugin](#install-ardusub_plugin), and finally [install the SUAVE workspace](#install-suave-workspace).

#### Install Gazebo Garden

Follow the [official instructions](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu) for installing Gazebo Garden.

#### Install ROS2 Humble

Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html) for installing ROS2 Humble.

#### Install ArduSub
ArduSub is a subproject within ArduPilot for piloting underwater vehicles.

**Disclaimer:**
Problems may occur with different combinations of ArduPilot and MavROS versions. This repo was tested with [this ArduPilot commit](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/94ba4ece5f9ccdf632b95938f8e644a622f5ee75) and [mavros 2.4.0](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/01eccd8). Unfortunately, at least at the time of writing this README, the releases available in Ubuntu 22.04 do not match.

```Bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
cd ardupilot
git checkout 2dd0bb7d4c85ac48437f139d66df648fc0e1d4ae
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Note that the script used to install prerequisites available for this
version of ArduSub does not work in Ubuntu 22.04. Therefore, you need to replace them before
running ArduSub. To install the ArduPilot prerequisites, do the following.

```Bash
cd ~/ardupilot
cd Tools/environment_install/
rm install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/master/Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh
cd ~/ardupilot
chmod +x Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh
Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y
. ~/.profile
```

To test if the installation worked, run:

```Bash
sim_vehicle.py -v ArduSub -L RATBeach --console --map
```
ArduPilot SITL should open and a console plus a map should appear.

#### Install the ArduSub plugin

Install the dependencies:

```Bash
sudo apt install libgz-sim7-dev rapidjson-dev
```

Clone and build the repository:

```Bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo
cd ardupilot_gazebo
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
make -j4
```

Add the required paths:

Assuming that you have cloned the repository in `$HOME/ardupilot_gazebo`, run:
```bash
echo 'export GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/ardupilot_gazebo/build:${GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=$HOME/ardupilot_gazebo/models:$HOME/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:${GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH}' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now that new environmental variables have been added to your terminal, you need to reload it with
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
More info about the plugin can be found in the corresponding [repository](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot_gazebo/).

### Install the SUAVE workspace

Create the workspace and download the required repositories:
```Bash
mkdir -p ~/suave_ws/src/
cd ~/suave_ws/
```

If you want to get the most updated version of the repo:

```Bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kas-lab/suave/main/suave.rosinstall
vcs import src < suave.rosinstall --recursive
```
**SEAMS2023:** If you want to get the version submitted to SEAMS 2023 instead of the most updated version get the following dependencies instead:

```Bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kas-lab/suave/9e6468896ce766376557ca9522d84f92b70129f1/suave.rosinstall
vcs import src < suave.rosinstall --recursive
```

Before building the `ros_gz` package (one of the dependencies), you need to export the gazebo version:

```
export GZ_VERSION="garden"
```
You can also add this to your `~/.bashrc` to make this process easier.

Install the dependencies:
```Bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
cd ~/suave_ws/
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

Build the project:
```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install
```

If you have memory problems while building the package, run the following command instead, it is slower but uses less memory:

```Bash
colcon build --symlink-install --executor sequential --parallel-workers 1
```

Install a MAVROS dependency:
```Bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo bash ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```

Now you can proceed to [run the exemplar](#run-suave).

## Run SUAVE

### Runner
#### Trying it out!
If you simply want to try out the exemplar, simply enter the following commands in a terminal:
```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/src/suave/runner/
./example_run.sh
```
Within a couple of minutes, some new terminals should open as well as the Gazebo simulator.
A default mission is executed of inspecting the pipeline with a time limit.
To follow the robot as it progresses along its mission make sure to right click and follow it in the entity tree of Gazebo as shown below:
![BLUEROV Follow](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/652db0676ec2995c4cc0653ef5de0fc49edd00ac/docker/follow_bluerov.PNG)

**Please note**: It can take a little while for the robot to get moving, it is an issue we are aware of. Once it does get a move on you should see it perform its mission for about 5 minutes.

#### Full Runner

To run the exemplar with the runner, first make sure you are in the suave workspace:

```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/src/suave/runner/
```

Then run:

Without gui:
```Bash
./runner.sh false metacontrol time 2
```

With gui:
```Bash
./runner.sh true metacontrol time 2
```

The runner script takes 4 positional parameters:
1. true or false -> indicates if the gui should be used
2. metacontrol or random or none -> indicates which managing subsystem to use
3. time or distance -> indicates which mission to run
4. number of runs

### Without the runner

**Configuring SUAVE:**
SUAVE has a number of parameters that may be of interest when running experiments with its missions, such as the time limit of a time constrained mission or the frequency of thruster failure. These can be found in the [mission_config.yaml](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_missions/config/mission_config.yaml) file. **Note:** When you change the mission_config file, you need to rebuild the suave_ws with `colcon build --symlink-install`

**Note:** Before starting the simulation or the ros nodes, remember that you have to source SUAVE's workspace. If you are using the dockerized version this is already done for you, therefore sourcing the workspace is not necessary.

Navigate to the workspace and source it:
```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/
source install/setup.bash
```

With SUAVE configured and sourced, start ArduSub, the simulation, and the SUAVE's nodes with the following instructions.

#### Start ArduSub

Run:
```Bash
sim_vehicle.py -L RATBeach -v ArduSub  --model=JSON --console
```

#### Start the simulation

Run:
```Bash
ros2 launch suave simulation.launch.py x:=-17.0 y:=2.0
```

**Note:** It is possible to pass arguments to specify the x and y coordinates of where the UUV spawns, by changing the values. In the above launch command the initial coordinates are set to (-17.0, 2.0).

#### Start SUAVE's nodes

Run:
```Bash
ros2 launch suave_missions mission.launch.py
```

**Mission results:** The mission results will be saved in the path specified in the [mission_config.yaml](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_missions/config/mission_config.yaml) file.

**Selecting the manging system and mission type:**
Launching the mission file without launch arguments will start a time-constrained mission without a managing subsystem. To select a different managing subsystem or a different type of mission, the following launch arguments can be used:

```
'adaptation_manager':
    Managing subsystem to be used
    available values: none/metacontrol/random
    (default: 'none')

'mission_type':
    Type of mission to be executed
    available values: time_constrained_mission/const_dist_mission
    (default: 'time_constrained_mission')

'result_filename':
    Filename for the mission measured metrics
    available values: any name
    (default: 'time_constrained_mission_results')
```

The arguments can be defined by adding the above arguments with the notation `<name>:=<value>` to the end of the command line.

An example of running the constant distance mission with metacontrol saving to a file called 'measurement_1':

```Bash
ros2 launch suave_missions mission.launch.py adaptation_manager:=metacontrol mission_type:=const_dist_mission result_filename:=measurement_1
```

## Extending SUAVE and connecting managing subsystems

### Connecting managing subsystems

SUAVE is designed to allow for different managing subsystems to be used, as long as they adhere to the correct ROS 2 interfaces.
SUAVE's ROS2 interfaces are:

1. The `/diagnostics` topic, which is where monitoring information is published. This topic uses the [diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/diagnostic_msgs/msg/DiagnosticArray.html) message type
2. The `/task/request` and `/task/cancel` services, which are used to request and cancel tasks, respectively. Both services use the [suave_msgs/Task](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_msgs/srv/Task.srv) service type
3. Three [system_modes](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes) services to change SUAVE's LifeCycle nodes mode. These services use the [system_modes_msgs/ChangeMode](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes/blob/master/system_modes_msgs/srv/ChangeMode.srv) service type:
    1. Service `/f_maintain_motion/change_mode` to change the Maintain Motion node modes
    2. Service `/f_generate_search_path/change_mode` to change the Generate Search Path node modes
    3. Service `/f_follow_pipeline/change_mode` to change the Follow Pipeline node modes

Thus, to connect a different managing subsystem to SUAVE, it must subscribe to `/diagnostics` to get monitoring information, send adaptation goals (task) requests via `/task/request` and `/task/cancel`, and send reconfiguration requests via `/f_maintain_motion/change_mode`, `/f_generate_search_path/change_mode`, or `/f_follow_pipeline/change_mode`.


In order to use the new managing subsystem with the launchfile [mission.launch.py](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_missions/launch/mission.launch.py) as explained in the [run suave](#run-suave) section, a new launchfile must be created for the new managing subsystem (check [suave_metacontrol.launch.py](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_metacontrol/launch/suave_metacontrol.launch.py) for an example), and the new launch file must be included in the [mission.launch.py](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_missions/launch/mission.launch.py) file.


The new launch file must include SUAVE's base launch:
```python
suave_launch_path = os.path.join(
        pkg_suave_path,
        'launch',
        'suave.launch.py')

suave_launch = IncludeLaunchDescription(
    PythonLaunchDescriptionSource(suave_launch_path),
    launch_arguments={
        'task_bridge': 'False'}.items()
)
```

To include it in [mission.launch.py](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave_missions/launch/mission.launch.py), add the following code replacing \[new_managing_subsystem\] with the proper name:

```python
[new_managing_subsystem]_launch_path = os.path.join(
        pkg_suave_metacontrol_path,
        'launch',
        '[new_managing_subsystem].launch.py')

[new_managing_subsystem]_launch = IncludeLaunchDescription(
        PythonLaunchDescriptionSource([new_managing_subsystem]_launch_path),
        condition=LaunchConfigurationEquals('adaptation_manager',
                    '[new_managing_subsystem]'))
```

### Extend SUAVE

To extend SUAVE with new functionalities, it is only required to add new LifeCycle nodes that implement the new functionalities (check [spiral_search_lc.py](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave/suave/spiral_search_lc.py) for an example), and add its different modes to the [system_modes](https://github.com/micro-ROS/system_modes) configuration file [suave_modes.yaml](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave/config/suave_modes.yaml). Note, that if you create a new configuration file, you should replace the [suave_modes.yaml](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/main/suave/config/suave_modes.yaml) path with the new file path.

## Troubleshooting

List of known problems and their solutions. If you find new problems and find a solution for it, please consider contributing to this section.

#### MAVROS and ArduSub integration problems:

A common problem that occurs over time is that some packages are upgraded in Ubuntu 22.04 and the connection between MAVROS and ArduSub stops working. I don't know how to fix this issue long term, but a workaround is to update MAVROS and/or ArduSub and check if it works again.

Before updating MAVROS and ArduSub upgrade your Ubuntu:

```Bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

**Update ArduSub:**

Due to ArduSub usage of submodules, it is simpler to just remove the whole ardupilo repo and build it from scratch again.

```Bash
rm -rf ~/ardupilot
```

To find the latest version of ArduSub go to the [ardupilot repo](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot) and look for the newest branch of ArduSub. At the time of this writing, the latest branch is [Sub-4.1](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/commits/Sub-4.1) at commit [e9f46b9](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/e9f46b91cda16cf7a48eb9861fea13e452c5c08c). After you know the latest branch or commit you want to get, follow the [install ardusub](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave#install-ardusub) instructions replacing the commit in `git checkout e9f46b9` with the commit/branch you selected.

**Update MAVROS:**
To update MAVROS, you can either change its version in the [suave.rosinstall](https://github.com/kas-lab/suave/blob/8f0e47571fc6c7524139fcb7ef20d9157d73a3e6/suave.rosinstall#L9) file with the newest version of [mavros](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros), or simply change the version to ros2. Then you need to pull the repo:

```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/
vcs pull src
```

Alternatively, instead of updating the suave.rosinstall file, you can just update mavros manually:

```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/src/mavros
git checkout ros2
git pull
```

Don't forget to rebuild the suave workspace:
```Bash
cd ~/suave_ws/
colcon build --symlink-install
```
